# 🎓 Learning Journal PWA: Flask Backend Integration

This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) built by **Ramesh Chaudhary** for the FGCT6021 Mobile Application Development unit. It serves as a learning log and portfolio, showcasing development skills across the stack.

## ✨ Project Overview

The application utilizes a **dual storage system**: browser `localStorage` for immediate client-side persistence and a **Flask backend** deployed on PythonAnywhere for robust, persistent server-side data management using JSON. The PWA implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for journal entries via a RESTful API.

### Core Technologies

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Design:** Mobile-First, Responsive Layout
* **Backend:** Python 3.x, **Flask** Web Framework
* **Data Persistence:** JSON file managed by Flask (`reflections.json`)
* **APIs:** Fetch API (for Flask communication), Local Storage API, Clipboard API
